# 🔗 LangGraph Learning Guide

LangGraph is a framework for building **stateful, multi-step workflows** with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It combines concepts of **graphs + reducers + state management** to make AI applications more structured and reliable.

## 📖 What is LangGraph?
LangGraph allows you to:
- Define **State** → a data object that flows through the workflow
- Build **Nodes** → functions that update the state
- Connect **Edges** → define the order of execution
- Run **Workflows** → compiled graphs that process input step by step
